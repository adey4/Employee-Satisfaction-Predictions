**Author**: Ankit Dey

### Business Problem:
The purpose of this project was to predict employee satisfaction using personal information from corporate data. Company leadership can then use this model to identify key changes in company culture that will have the largest influence on increasing employee satisfaction.

### Data:
Data was sourced from a corporate partner of Coding Dojo. The dataset contains 22 features related to employee personal information and 20000 observations.

### Methods used:
- Data mining
- Data cleaning and processing
- Exploratory analyses
- Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Keras
- Model evaluation based on regression metrics 

### Model Evaluation:
The final model is an ANN containing two hidden layers with ReLu activation.

This model shows an accuracy of 97%, precision of 98%, recall of 95%, and f1-score of 96%. It accurately predicts satisfaction for 97% of employees with a similar amount of false negative and false positive errors.
